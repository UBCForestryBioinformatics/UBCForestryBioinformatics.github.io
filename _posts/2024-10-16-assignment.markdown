### The genetic basis of a flesh colour polymorphism in Chinook Salmon


![Image](/posts/assignment_pics/FishPic.jpg)


As the final part of the workshop, you are asked to complete an analysis that weaves together the various concepts from across the week. 

Your colaborators have sequneced the genomes of 22 individual Chinook Salmon (11 with red flesh, 11 with white flesh). Each individual has been sequenced to approximately 10x coverage using Illumina HiSeq paired-end reads. The FASTQs have been trimmed and screened for quality. It is your job to build a pipeline to analyse these genomic data and to help identify candidate loci underlying the flesh colour polymorphism.

________________

The assignment is to build a pipeline to use sequence data to identify the causal gene.
* 75% of your mark comes from building the pipeline - using comments to show that you understand the different steps
* You get the remaining 25% of your mark if the pipeline works on the server you are assigned to
* Extra credit will be given if you correctly identify the causal gene underlying the flesh colour polymorphism


### Assignment Data

*The data for the assignment has been deposited at the following location on the servers:*
 ```/mnt/data/Assignment/fastq/```



You have used all the additional data you require for this assignment throughout the week. Those data are:
* ```SalmonReference.fasta```
* ```SalmonAnnotations.gff```
